This project took shape during our Final project of our Bachelor of Engineering at BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore

Railway transport system has proved to be a very sturdy and convenient mode of transport
over the centuries. It still serves as the cheapest and most efficient means of mass transport in
many countries. It is a widespread practice even today, that most operations are manually
carried out, leading to several dangerous accidents and mis-management of the system.
When it comes to the matter of scores of lives, error margin is of utmost importance to ensure
an efficient and safe mode of travel. There is an utter need for a system that provides
automation of the critical systems that play a pivotal role in the smooth functioning. The
focus remains on certain key functions including locomotion, data logging for position,
speed, and health of the locomotive. This can increase the safety levels, while also reducing
the time for relief in-case of unfortunate emergencies.

Our project focussed on engineering implementation of different accident avoindance aspects that 
can be integrated, safety protocols to better handle any unpredictable accidents and also some tools
that can help commuters better organise their schedule and save on time. To build a prototype of the
system, IR sensors, Ultrasound sensor, NRF24L01 wireless modules, motion sensors, 
L293D Dual H-bridge motor driver, 6V DC-motors, SIM900A GSM module and 5V-9V voltage booster were used.
This implementation can be extended in real time with devices of higher range and better reliability to
overcome short comings and enchance efficiency in existing infrastructure.

The same project was published as a research article of International Journal of Advanced 
Engineering, Management and Science (IJAEMS).
